# AICTE--Internship
This repo is to store the code for the project I build during the course of my internship. I have recieved an internship oppurtunity in Edunet Foundation, in
collaboration with AICTE & Shell. The project i am doing is E-waste Classification. I have created a MODEL to detect which category the E-waste belongs from the image.
